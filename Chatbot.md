                                  <p>Dear Sika Industry Academy users,&nbsp;</p><p>Sika will change its own IdP provider. This provider is responsible for the Single Sign On (SSO) for all applications of Sika. This change will affect the SSO access of Sika Industry Academy as follows:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Firefox cannot be used any more</li><li>Microsoft Edge browser is the preferred browser according our IT. It is based on chromium (Google Chrome) and has the best integration for Windows operating systems&nbsp;</li><li>Once the application is being authenticated through our Azure tenant, you receive a message on Firefox “You can’t get there from here..:”. The error Message shows that the browser is not supported and you should use&nbsp;<strong>Internet Explorer, Chrome or Microsoft Edge</strong>. To import favorites from Firefox to Microsoft Edge follow these steps:</li></ol><ul><li>Open Edge Explorer</li><li>Press Ctrl + Shift + O</li><li>Klick on the three dots…</li><li>Klick on “import favorites”</li><li>Select “Mozilla Firefox”</li></ul><p>Note: The change of the IdP provider is done separately for each application. If you wonder about own or local applications in your country, ask your local IT about the schedule of the change.</p>
